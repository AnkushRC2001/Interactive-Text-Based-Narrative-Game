## 📖 Overview

**Ashes of Calcutta** is an interactive fiction experience written entirely in Python.  
It follows **Arunesh Chatterjee**, a widowed clerk trapped in Calcutta during the 1946 riots, as he searches for his missing daughter, **Mitali**, through a city consumed by fire, fear, and faith.

The story unfolds across **five acts**, blending historical realism, emotional storytelling, and player-driven moral choices.  
Each decision shapes Arunesh’s journey — what he carries, who he helps, and ultimately, how he survives.

> “The city burns, the river mourns, and a father walks through the ashes to find what’s left of love.”
