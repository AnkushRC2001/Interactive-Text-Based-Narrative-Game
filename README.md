# Ashes of Calcutta  
*A narrative-driven text adventure set during the Calcutta Riots of 1946*  
**By Ankush Roy Chowdhury**

## Overview

**Ashes of Calcutta** is an interactive fiction game set in August 1946, during the Great Calcutta Killings.  
You play as **Arunesh Chatterjee**, a clerk who awakens in a locked-down store as riots erupt across the city.  
Separated from his daughter **Mitali**, Arunesh must navigate through a burning, divided Calcutta — making choices that test his morality, endurance, and hope.

The game is entirely text-based, inspired by Telltale’s branching storytelling style.  
Every act reacts to your decisions, shaping the tone, the people you meet, and the things you carry forward.  
There are no heroes here — only survivors trying to hold onto their humanity.

## Story

Calcutta, 1946.  
The city stands on the brink — torn apart by politics, faith, and vengeance.  
Amid curfews and fires, a father wakes up behind the shutter of a deserted store, struck unconscious when panic spread through the streets.  
Outside, the air is thick with smoke and slogans. Somewhere, his daughter is still out there.

**Ashes of Calcutta** unfolds through five acts:

1. **The Lockdown** — Arunesh awakens in the store as chaos erupts outside.  
2. **The Crossing** — He attempts to flee across the Hooghly, making a choice that will define his journey.  
3. **The Road to Tikiapara** — Struggling through ruins, he discovers where Mitali might be — and meets a wounded stray dog.  
4. **The Return** — Across burning Burrabazar and Harrison Road, he fights his way back toward Rajendra Deb Lane.  
5. **The Ashes Remember** — A father and daughter find each other, only to face the weight of what they’ve lost — and what they’ve become.

## Gameplay

- The story unfolds as **typed dialogue and narration**, appearing slowly on-screen to feel like a typewriter.  
- **Numbered choices** appear at key moments — type the number to select your response.  
- Each decision affects:
  - Your **morality** (compassion vs. ruthlessness)  
  - Your **inventory** (items you keep or lose)  
  - Your **health and stamina**  
- These variables carry through all acts, changing future dialogue and outcomes.  
- There are no “right” answers — only consequences.

## Themes

- **Loss and Survival** — What do we become when the world around us burns?  
- **Faith and Division** — How fear and belief fracture a city — and a soul.  
- **Parenthood and Hope** — The bond between Arunesh and Mitali drives the story through fire and ruin.  
- **Moral Consequence** — Every decision leaves a mark; some seen, others carried within.

## Setting Authenticity

The story recreates 1940s Calcutta with historical realism —  
College Street, Bagbazar, Howrah, Tikiapara, Mullick Ghat, Burrabazar, Harrison Road, and Rajendra Deb Lane.  
Each location mirrors the tension and tragedy of that time — smoke over the Hooghly,  
streets littered with pamphlets, and the distant toll of trams derailed in chaos.

Every act was written to place you inside that world —  
the sounds, the fear, the stillness before dawn, and the strange kindness that survives even amid destruction.

## Inspirations

- **Telltale Games** — for narrative branching and emotional choice systems.  
- **This War of Mine** — for moral realism in wartime storytelling.  
- **Satyajit Ray & Ritwik Ghatak** — for the poetic visual sense of Bengal in crisis.  
- **Historical Accounts of the 1946 Riots** — for grounding every moment in truth.

## Author’s Note

> “Ashes of Calcutta is not about heroes.  
> It is about the people history forgets — the fathers searching for their daughters,  
> the shopkeepers who hide strangers, the children who still laugh amid the smoke.  
> It is about a city learning to live again, one street at a time.”
